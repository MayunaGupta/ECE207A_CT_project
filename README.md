# BENG280A/ECE207A_CT_project
----------------------
This repository is meant for our calcium scoring and analysis project. 

A coronary calcium (CAC) scan uses a CT (computed tomography) machine to capture the detailed images of your heart. The cardiac calcium score generated from this test is used to assess the occurrence of coronary artery diseases and heart attacks

We use the code here to calculate various parameters that affect the calculation of the Agatston Scoring and analyse the effect of resolution on Agatston Scoring. 

##How to use the code:
------------------------
The code requires the use of a private dataset shared by Dr Elliot McVeigh from UCSD
The segmentation files were generated using Slicer3D
Several functions have been placed inside the Jupyter Notebook provided which is used to generate the variables
